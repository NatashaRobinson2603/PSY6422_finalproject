Participant Ratings of Seven Traumatic Scenarios: A Stacked Barplot

Summary: The data was taken from 'Psychological Response Data on the Traumatic Nature of 600 Written Events' (Jones, Bellet, Levari & McNally, 2021). 250 participants completed the online survey. The plot presents 7 scenarios which 45 participants rated on a scale of 1-7. Pariticipants rated how traumatic they percieved each scenario. 1 indicating "Not Traumatic, 7 indicating "Highly Traumatic".

Motivation: To observe how participants rated different imagined traumatic scenarios, and compare scenario ratings.

What does this plot tell us? Participants rated "witnessed maimed human corpes while working at a refugee camp" most traumatic whereas, "watched a consensual pornographic film involving violence" was rated least traumatic. Interestingly, "witnessed a friend being beaten to death" was rated as less traumatic that "witnessed human corpses while working at a refugge camp" despite item "witnessed a friend being beated to death" including a similar level of cost but with more emotional attachment. Perhaps the data suggests that item phrasing impacts the overall rating of how traumatic a scenario is percieved. The terms "maimed" and "corpses" may elicit a more significant emotional response, therefore such phrasing could lead participants to rate such scenarios as more traumatic. Although, more research would need to be conducted to investigate this concept further.
